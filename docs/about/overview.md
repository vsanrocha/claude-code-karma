# Claude Karma — Overview

## What is Claude Karma?

Claude Karma is a full-stack monitoring and analytics dashboard for [Claude Code](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code) sessions. It parses Claude Code's local storage (`~/.claude/`), extracts structured data from raw JSONL session files, and presents it through an interactive web dashboard.

## The Problem

Claude Code stores all session data locally as raw JSONL files scattered across `~/.claude/projects/`. These files contain rich information — conversations, tool calls, token usage, subagent activity, file operations — but are effectively invisible to the user. There is no built-in way to:

- Browse past sessions across projects
- Track token usage and costs over time
- Monitor live sessions in real time
- Analyze tool usage patterns or agent behavior
- Replay conversations or inspect timelines

Claude Karma makes all of this accessible through a single dashboard.

## Who Is It For?

- **Claude Code power users** who run dozens of sessions daily and want visibility into their usage
- **Developers** who want to understand how Claude Code interacts with their codebase
- **Teams** evaluating Claude Code adoption and needing usage analytics
- **Hook developers** building on Claude Code's extensibility layer

## Key Capabilities

- **Session Browser** — Browse, search, and filter all sessions across every project
- **Timeline View** — Chronological event stream with messages, tool calls, and subagent activity
- **Conversation Playback** — Full conversation viewer with user and assistant messages
- **Token and Cost Tracking** — Per-session and aggregate token usage with cost estimates
- **File Activity Tracking** — See which files were read, written, or modified
- **Live Session Monitoring** — Real-time session state via Claude Code hooks
- **Analytics Dashboards** — Project-level and global analytics with charts
- **Agent and Skill Analytics** — Track subagent spawning patterns and skill usage
- **MCP Tool Tracking** — Monitor MCP tool discovery and invocation
- **Session Chains** — Detect and link related or resumed sessions
- **Command Palette** — Quick navigation with Ctrl+K

## Tech Stack

| Layer | Technology |
|-------|-----------|
| Backend | Python 3.10+, FastAPI, Pydantic 2.x, aiofiles |
| Frontend | SvelteKit 2, Svelte 5 (runes), Tailwind CSS 4, Chart.js 4, bits-ui |
| Hooks | captain-hook (Pydantic models for Claude Code's 10 hook types) |
| Tooling | ruff (Python), eslint/prettier (JS), pytest, vitest |

## Architecture

Claude Karma is a monorepo with three git submodules:

| Submodule | Description | Port |
|-----------|-------------|------|
| `api/` | FastAPI backend — parses JSONL, serves REST endpoints | 8000 |
| `frontend/` | SvelteKit dashboard — visualizes session data | 5173 |
| `captain-hook/` | Pydantic library — type-safe models for Claude Code hooks | — |

A `hooks/` directory contains production hook scripts that integrate with Claude Code for live tracking and automation.
