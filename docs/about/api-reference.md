## Common Response Patterns

### Pagination

List endpoints that return large datasets support query parameters:

| Parameter | Type | Description |
|-----------|------|-------------|
| `limit` | int | Maximum number of items to return |
| `offset` | int | Number of items to skip |

### Error Responses

Errors follow standard HTTP status codes with JSON bodies:

```json
{
  "detail": "Session not found: abc-123"
}
```

| Status | Meaning |
|--------|---------|
| 200 | Success |
| 404 | Resource not found (invalid UUID, unknown project) |
| 422 | Validation error (malformed parameters) |
| 500 | Internal server error (JSONL parse failure, filesystem error) |

### Path Encoding

Project endpoints use encoded path names. The encoding converts filesystem paths to URL-safe strings by replacing `/` with `-` and prefixing with `-`:

```
/Users/me/project  -->  -Users-me-project
```

Use the value from the `/projects` listing as the `encoded_name` parameter.
